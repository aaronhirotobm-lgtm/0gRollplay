## Config

- **JWT issuance** – `POST /api/auth` in `controllers/auth.js` signs a JWT with `config.JWT_SECRET_KEY` (see `SESSION_EXPIRES_IN`). The payload only contains `user.id` so you can safely extend it.
- **Client storage** – Tokens are pushed into Axios’ default headers via `client/src/helpers/setAuthToken.js`. Persist them in `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` from your auth screen and call `setAuthToken(token)` on boot.
- **Protected routes** – `middleware/auth.js` expects the token in the `x-auth-token` header and injects `req.user`. Use the middleware on any route that needs authenticated identity.
